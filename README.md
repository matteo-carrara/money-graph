# money-graph
Python script to generate insightful graphs of **income, expenses, and net worth** from personal finance apps

This script currently works only with the CSV export from **Money Manager: Expense Tracker**, a free app available on the Play Store (note: I am not the owner of this app). The script can be easily adapted to handle other types of exports if needed.

Below are some sample screenshots with random data to illustrate the concept: each point on the graph represents a day, associated with a monetary value ($). Hovering over the points displays a tooltip with the exact amount. The graph is interactive and can be controlled using the mouse.
